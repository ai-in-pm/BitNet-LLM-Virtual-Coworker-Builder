        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
        These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been
        the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels
        like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases.
        
        Key facts:
        - Global temperature has risen by about 1.1Â°C since the pre-industrial period
        - The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record
        - Sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3.7 mm per year
        - Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13.1% per decade
        
        Addressing climate change requires both mitigation (reducing emissions) and
        adaptation (adjusting to current and future effects).
