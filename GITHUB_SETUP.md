# GitHub Setup Guide

This document provides instructions for setting up and managing the BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder GitHub repository.

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

### Option 1: Using the Automated Script

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to the BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder directory
3. Run the push script:

```powershell
.\push_to_github.ps1
```

This script will:
- Initialize a Git repository if needed
- Add the remote origin
- Stage all changes
- Commit the changes with a descriptive message
- Push the changes to GitHub

### Option 2: Manual Git Commands

If you prefer to use Git commands directly:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder directory
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
# Initialize Git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Add the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/ai-in-pm/BitNet-LLM-Virtual-Coworker-Builder.git

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add production setup, monitoring, and backup systems"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Setting Up GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.

### Enabling GitHub Actions

1. Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ai-in-pm/BitNet-LLM-Virtual-Coworker-Builder
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. You should see the workflow we've created. Click on "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"

### Workflow Configuration

The CI/CD workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes:

- Testing on multiple operating systems and Python versions
- Building documentation
- Building the Python package
- Building the Tauri desktop application
- Creating releases (when tags are pushed)

### Triggering Workflows

The workflow is triggered on:
- Push to the main branch
- Pull requests to the main branch
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

To manually trigger a workflow:
1. Go to the "Actions" tab
2. Select the workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

## Testing Production Setup

To test the production setup on a clean system:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ai-in-pm/BitNet-LLM-Virtual-Coworker-Builder.git
cd BitNet-LLM-Virtual-Coworker-Builder
```

2. Run the production setup script:
```powershell
.\setup_production.ps1
```

3. Verify that the setup completed successfully:
```powershell
.\test_production_setup.ps1
```

4. Test the monitoring setup:
```powershell
cd monitoring
.\setup_monitoring.ps1
```

5. Test the backup setup:
```powershell
cd backup
.\setup_backup.ps1
```

## Documenting Issues

If you encounter any issues during testing:

1. Go to the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ai-in-pm/BitNet-LLM-Virtual-Coworker-Builder
2. Click on the "Issues" tab
3. Click "New issue"
4. Select the appropriate issue template
5. Fill in the details:
   - Title: A clear, concise description of the issue
   - Description: Detailed information about the issue, including:
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Expected behavior
     - Actual behavior
     - Screenshots or error messages
     - Environment information (OS, Python version, etc.)
6. Click "Submit new issue"

## Engaging with the Community

### GitHub Issues

Use GitHub Issues for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- Task tracking

### GitHub Discussions

Use GitHub Discussions for:
- Q&A
- Ideas and feedback
- General discussions

### Pull Requests

Encourage contributions through pull requests:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a branch for your changes
3. Make your changes
4. Submit a pull request
5. Review and merge the pull request

## GitHub Repository Management

### Branch Protection

To protect the main branch:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Branches" in the left sidebar
4. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
5. Enter "main" as the branch name pattern
6. Configure the protection rules:
