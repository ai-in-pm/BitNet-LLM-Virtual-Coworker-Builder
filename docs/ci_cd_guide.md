# CI/CD Guide for BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder

This guide explains how to use and customize the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions and is defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file. The pipeline includes:

- Testing on multiple operating systems and Python versions
- Linting and type checking
- Building documentation
- Building the Python package
- Building the Tauri desktop application
- Creating releases

## Workflow Structure

The workflow consists of several jobs:

1. **test**: Runs tests, linting, and type checking on multiple operating systems and Python versions
2. **build-docs**: Builds the documentation and deploys it to GitHub Pages
3. **build-package**: Builds the Python package
4. **build-tauri**: Builds the Tauri desktop application for multiple platforms
5. **release**: Creates a GitHub release with all artifacts

## Triggering the Workflow

The workflow is triggered on:
- Push to the main branch
- Pull requests to the main branch
- Manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)

### Manual Trigger

To manually trigger the workflow:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Select the "CI/CD Pipeline" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Select the branch and click "Run workflow"

## Customizing the Workflow

### Changing Python Versions

To change the Python versions tested:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    python-version: [3.8, 3.9, '3.10']  # Modify this line
```

### Adding Dependencies

To add dependencies for testing:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    python -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install pytest pytest-cov flake8 mypy
    pip install -e ".[dev]"
    # Add additional dependencies here
```

### Changing Build Parameters

To change the build parameters for the Tauri application:

```yaml
- name: Build Tauri app
  run: |
    cd tauri-ui
    npm run tauri build
    # Add additional build parameters here
```

## Monitoring Workflow Runs

To monitor workflow runs:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Actions" tab
3. Click on a workflow run to see details
4. Click on a job to see the logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tests Failing

If tests are failing:
1. Check the test logs to identify the failing tests
2. Run the tests locally to reproduce the issue
3. Fix the failing tests
4. Push the changes

#### Build Failing

If the build is failing:
1. Check the build logs to identify the issue
2. Try to reproduce the issue locally
3. Fix the build issues
4. Push the changes

#### Deployment Failing

If deployment is failing:
1. Check the deployment logs to identify the issue
2. Ensure that the GitHub token has the necessary permissions
3. Fix the deployment issues
4. Push the changes

### Getting Help

If you need help with the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Check the GitHub Actions documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/actions
2. Ask for help in the GitHub Discussions
3. Open an issue on GitHub

## Advanced Configuration

### Adding Custom Actions

To add custom actions to the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Custom Action
  uses: owner/repo@version
  with:
    param1: value1
    param2: value2
```

### Environment Variables

To add environment variables to the workflow:

```yaml
env:
  MY_VAR: my-value

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      JOB_VAR: job-value
    steps:
      - name: Use environment variables
        run: |
          echo "Global variable: $MY_VAR"
          echo "Job variable: $JOB_VAR"
```

### Secrets

To use secrets in the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Use secrets
  env:
    MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
  run: |
    echo "Using secret: $MY_SECRET"
```

To add secrets:
1. Go to the GitHub repository
2. Click on the "Settings" tab
3. Click on "Secrets and variables" in the left sidebar
4. Click on "Actions"
5. Click "New repository secret"
6. Enter the name and value
7. Click "Add secret"

## Conclusion

The CI/CD pipeline helps ensure that the codebase is always in a deployable state by automatically testing, building, and deploying the application. By following this guide, you can effectively use and customize the CI/CD pipeline for BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder.
