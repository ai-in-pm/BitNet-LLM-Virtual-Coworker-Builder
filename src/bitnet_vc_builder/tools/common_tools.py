            Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns.
            These shifts may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities have been
            the main driver of climate change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels
            like coal, oil, and gas, which produces heat-trapping gases.
            
            Key facts:
            - Global temperature has risen by about 1.1Â°C since the pre-industrial period
            - The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record
            - Sea levels are rising at a rate of about 3.7 mm per year
            - Arctic sea ice is declining at a rate of 13.1% per decade
            
            Addressing climate change requires both mitigation (reducing emissions) and
            adaptation (adjusting to current and future effects).

            Renewable energy is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished

            - Solar energy: Harnessing energy from the sun
            - Wind energy: Converting wind into electricity
            - Hydroelectric energy: Using flowing water to generate power
            - Geothermal energy: Using heat from the Earth's interior
            - Biomass energy: Using organic material from plants and animals
            
            Renewable energy accounted for about 29% of global electricity generation in 2020,
            with hydropower being the largest source followed by wind and solar.
