## Quick Start

### Single Virtual Co-worker

Create a simple virtual co-worker that can search the web and answer questions:

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder import BitNetVirtualCoworker, BitNetModel, Tool

# Initialize BitNet model
model = BitNetModel(
    model_path="models/bitnet-b1.58-2b",
    kernel_type="i2_s",  # Options: i2_s (default), tl1, tl2
    num_threads=4,       # Number of CPU threads to use
    context_size=2048,   # Maximum context size
    temperature=0.7      # Generation temperature (0.0-1.0)
)

# Create a web search tool
def web_search(query):
    """Simple web search function (replace with actual implementation)"""
    # This is a placeholder - implement actual web search functionality
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

search_tool = Tool(
    name="search",
    description="Search the web for information",
    function=web_search,
    args_schema={
        "query": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Search query"
        }
    }
)

# Create a calculator tool
def calculator(expression):
    """Simple calculator tool"""
    try:
        return eval(expression)
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"

calculator_tool = Tool(
    name="calculator",
    description="Calculate a mathematical expression",
    function=calculator,
    args_schema={
        "expression": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Mathematical expression to calculate"
        }
    }
)

# Create virtual co-worker with tools
coworker = BitNetVirtualCoworker(
    model=model,
    tools=[search_tool, calculator_tool],
    name="AssistantCoworker",
    description="A helpful virtual co-worker that can search the web and perform calculations"
)

# Run virtual co-worker on a task
result = coworker.run("Find information about climate change and calculate the average temperature increase per decade")
print(result)
```

### Multi-Co-worker Collaboration

Create a team of specialized virtual co-workers that work together to solve complex tasks:

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder import BitNetVirtualCoworker, BitNetModel, Tool, BitNetTeam
from bitnet_vc_builder.core.team import CollaborationMode
from bitnet_vc_builder.memory.memory import Memory

# Initialize BitNet model
model = BitNetModel(model_path="models/bitnet-b1.58-2b")

# Create shared memory for the team
shared_memory = Memory(max_items=100)

# Create specialized tools for each virtual co-worker
def web_search(query):
    """Web search function"""
    return f"Search results for: {query}"

def analyze_data(data):
    """Data analysis function"""
    return f"Analysis of data: {data}"

def generate_report(title, content):
    """Report generation function"""
    return f"# {title}\n\n{content}"

# Create virtual co-workers with specialized tools
researcher = BitNetVirtualCoworker(
    model=model,
    tools=[Tool(name="search", description="Search the web", function=web_search)],
    name="Researcher",
    description="A virtual co-worker that specializes in research and information gathering",
    memory=shared_memory
)

analyst = BitNetVirtualCoworker(
    model=model,
    tools=[Tool(name="analyze", description="Analyze data", function=analyze_data)],
    name="Analyst",
    description="A virtual co-worker that specializes in data analysis and interpretation",
    memory=shared_memory
)

writer = BitNetVirtualCoworker(
    model=model,
    tools=[Tool(name="generate_report", description="Generate a report", function=generate_report)],
    name="Writer",
    description="A virtual co-worker that specializes in writing clear and concise reports",
    memory=shared_memory
)

# Create a team with different collaboration modes
team = BitNetTeam(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    name="ResearchTeam",
    description="A team that researches topics, analyzes data, and writes reports",
    collaboration_mode=CollaborationMode.HIERARCHICAL,  # Options: SEQUENTIAL, HIERARCHICAL, PARALLEL
    enable_conflict_resolution=True,
    enable_task_prioritization=True,
    enable_performance_tracking=True
)

# Run the team on a task
result = team.run(
    "Research climate change, analyze the data on temperature changes over the last century, and write a comprehensive report"
)
print(result)
```

### Using the Configuration File

You can also configure and run virtual co-workers using a YAML configuration file:

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder.main import load_config, create_agent, create_team

# Load configuration from file
config = load_config("config/config.yaml")

# Create model, virtual co-workers, and teams from configuration
model = load_model(config)
agents = {agent_config["name"]: create_agent(agent_config, model) for agent_config in config.get("agents", [])}
teams = {team_config["name"]: create_team(team_config, agents) for team_config in config.get("teams", [])}

# Run a virtual co-worker
result = agents["AssistantCoworker"].run("What is the capital of France?")
print(result)

# Run a team
result = teams["ResearchTeam"].run("Research quantum computing advancements in 2023")
print(result)
```

class CodeVirtualCoworker(BitNetVirtualCoworker):
    """A virtual co-worker specialized for code generation and review."""

    def __init__(self, model, tools=None, name=None, description=None, memory=None, supported_languages=None):
        super().__init__(model, tools, name, description, memory)
        self.supported_languages = supported_languages or ["python", "javascript", "java"]

    def generate_code(self, language, requirements):
        """Generate code in the specified language based on requirements."""
        if language not in self.supported_languages:
            return f"Sorry, I don't support {language}. Supported languages: {', '.join(self.supported_languages)}"

        prompt = f"Generate {language} code for: {requirements}"
        return self.run(prompt)

    def review_code(self, code, language):
        """Review code and provide feedback."""
        prompt = f"Review this {language} code and provide feedback:\n\n```{language}\n{code}\n```"
        return self.run(prompt)
```

### Custom Tools

Create specialized tools for virtual co-workers:

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder import Tool
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import io
import base64

def analyze_data(data_str, analysis_type="summary"):
    """
    Analyze data and return results.

    Args:
        data_str: CSV data as a string
        analysis_type: Type of analysis to perform (summary, correlation, visualization)

    Returns:
        Analysis results
    """
    # Convert string data to DataFrame
    data = pd.read_csv(io.StringIO(data_str))

    if analysis_type == "summary":
        return data.describe().to_string()

    elif analysis_type == "correlation":
        return data.corr().to_string()

    elif analysis_type == "visualization":
        # Create a simple visualization
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
        data.plot()
        plt.title("Data Visualization")

        # Convert plot to base64 string
        buffer = io.BytesIO()
        plt.savefig(buffer, format="png")
        buffer.seek(0)
        image_base64 = base64.b64encode(buffer.read()).decode("utf-8")

        return f"data:image/png;base64,{image_base64}"

    else:
        return f"Unknown analysis type: {analysis_type}"

# Create the tool
data_analysis_tool = Tool(
    name="analyze_data",
    description="Analyze data and return results",
    function=analyze_data,
    args_schema={
        "data_str": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "CSV data as a string"
        },
        "analysis_type": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Type of analysis to perform (summary, correlation, visualization)",
            "enum": ["summary", "correlation", "visualization"],
            "default": "summary"
        }
    }
)
```

### Advanced Team Configurations

Configure teams with different collaboration modes and strategies:

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder import BitNetTeam, CollaborationMode

# Create a team with hierarchical collaboration
team = BitNetTeam(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    name="ResearchTeam",
    description="A team that researches topics, analyzes data, and writes reports",
    collaboration_mode=CollaborationMode.HIERARCHICAL,
    coordinator_agent="researcher",  # Specify which virtual co-worker coordinates the team
    enable_conflict_resolution=True,
    conflict_resolution_strategy="voting",  # Options: voting, consensus, authority
    enable_task_prioritization=True,
