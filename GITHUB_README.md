A powerful and efficient AI virtual co-worker framework built on top of BitNet's 1-bit quantized language models.

## Overview

BitNet_LLM_Virtual_Coworker_Builder is a Python framework for creating AI virtual co-workers powered by BitNet's highly efficient 1-bit quantized language models. This framework enables the development of sophisticated AI virtual co-workers that can run on edge devices with limited resources, offering significant advantages in terms of speed, energy efficiency, and deployment flexibility.

## Key Features

- **Efficient Inference**: Leverages BitNet's 1-bit quantization for fast and energy-efficient inference
- **Edge Deployment**: Run sophisticated virtual co-workers on CPUs without requiring specialized hardware
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend and customize virtual co-worker capabilities
- **Tool Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with external tools and APIs
- **Multi-Co-worker Collaboration**: Create teams of specialized virtual co-workers
- **Memory Management**: Efficient context and memory management for long-running virtual co-workers
- **Hardware Optimization**: Automatically optimizes for different CPU architectures
- **Specialized Tools**: Includes ready-to-use tools for various tasks
- **Web-Based UI**: User-friendly interface for managing virtual co-workers
- **Desktop Application**: Cross-platform desktop application built with Tauri
- **Comprehensive API**: RESTful API for programmatic control
- **Production Ready**: Includes monitoring, backup, and deployment tools

## Quick Start

```python
from bitnet_vc_builder import BitNetVirtualCoworker, BitNetModel, Tool

# Initialize BitNet model
model = BitNetModel(model_path="models/bitnet-b1.58-2b")

# Create virtual co-worker
coworker = BitNetVirtualCoworker(
    model=model,
    name="AssistantCoworker",
    description="A helpful virtual co-worker"
)

# Run virtual co-worker on a task
result = coworker.run("What is the capital of France?")
print(result)
```
